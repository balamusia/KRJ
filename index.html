      Joshua Allen Harris creates inflatable art pieces using plastic bags. These sculptures are placed over subway grates and briefly inflate when a train passes.
      I'm very interested in these artworks, especially the unique origin of their movement. There are many opportunities to create meaning based on this air movement generated by a passing train, and the kind of death and resurrection of the sculptures that ensues.
