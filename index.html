      Joshua Allen Harris creates inflatable art pieces using plastic bags. These sculptures are placed over subway grates and briefly inflate when a train passes.
      I'm very interested in these artworks, especially the unique origin of their movement. There are many opportunities to create meaning based on this air movement generated by a passing train, and the kind of death and resurrection of the sculptures that ensues.

      September 26, 2022: It Shall Be Mine

<p>
  "It Shall Be Mine" is an atomic clock that is confined by magnets, preventing it from ticking.
  It's always very interesting to me when an object's purpose is subverted in art. This piece in particular also shows that very small movements can be really profound and full of meaning. The magnets constrain the ticking of the clock just enough that you can see this very small movement, as though the hand of the clock is struggling against this incredible force.

      October 3, 2022: Can't Help Myself

      This is one of the first kinetic sculptures I ever saw, and I credit it as what got me interested in art and technology. I'm very interested in the idea of a living machine, one that feels and bleeds like a human but is structurally very inhuman.
      One subject that I am exploring a lot in my own art this year is feelings of fear, struggle, and helplessness. The way this machine moves and even the sounds it makes evoke agony. On a grander level, I feel that the line between biology and artifice will continue to blur as technology advances -- how can I express my pain through a synthetic body?

      These things are fucking scary. I also don't totally believe that these are real and not CGI, but this entry isn't about my conspiracies on the military industrial complex.
      These robots tie into the feelings I expressed in my previous entry, about living machines. These robots move exactly like humans, better and more agile than most humans actually but still with distinctly organic movements. I don't expect to ever achieve this degree of fluidity in any kinetic art I make, but it still inspires me.
