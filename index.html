      Joshua Allen Harris creates inflatable art pieces using plastic bags. These sculptures are placed over subway grates and briefly inflate when a train passes.
      I'm very interested in these artworks, especially the unique origin of their movement. There are many opportunities to create meaning based on this air movement generated by a passing train, and the kind of death and resurrection of the sculptures that ensues.

<p>
  "It Shall Be Mine" is an atomic clock that is confined by magnets, preventing it from ticking.
  It's always very interesting to me when an object's purpose is subverted in art. This piece in particular also shows that very small movements can be really profound and full of meaning. The magnets constrain the ticking of the clock just enough that you can see this very small movement, as though the hand of the clock is struggling against this incredible force.
